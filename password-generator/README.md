# Password Generator
**This a simple python project on how to create a password generator.**
It begins by importing the required libraries i.e. 
- **random** (to generate the random numbers and characters)
- **tkinker** (for creating the Graphical User Interface, GUI)
- **string** (for strings in the password)

After that I proceeded to create the random password using a function called generate_password. I specified the items needed for the password(numbers, symbols and strings) using **FOR loops**.
After that I created the GUI.
