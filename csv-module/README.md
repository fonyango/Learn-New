# read-csv-file-using-csv-module

Reading a csv file in python using a csv module is pretty easy. The process is as follows:

- Begin by importing the csv library.
- Use open() function to open the csv file as a file object. The open() function is a python in-built function.
- Use csv reader to convert the file object to a csv.reader object.
- Create a for loop to loop through the rows and store data.
- Print the rows. You can specify the number of rows you want to print by using an if statement.
