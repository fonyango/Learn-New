This simple project is on how to show dates and times on videos captured using webcam. It uses OpenCV.

First, obviously it begins by importing **cv2** and **datetime** libraries
After that, a video is captured. Then using **WHILE loops** and **IF statements** you can specify the font types, style, color, and the datetime.
