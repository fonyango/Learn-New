OS module is a standard library that comes with python 3. This means that its part of the python installation and therefore you donâ€™t need to install it separately. The key role for OS module is to communicate/interact with the operating system of your machine. 

Its specific roles include;

- Checking (identifying) the current working directory (folder)
- Changing the working directory
- Creating directories
- Removing directories 
- Accessing a list of files in a directory

This code shows how to perform the above functions using os in jupyter notebook.
